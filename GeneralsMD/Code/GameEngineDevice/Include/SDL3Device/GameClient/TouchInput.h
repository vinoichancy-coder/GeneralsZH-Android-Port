** TouchInput.h
**
** GeneralsX @feature Android port 06/09/2026 Native touch input: battlefield
** gestures expressed as what the player meant, resolved by the engine's own rules,
** with no synthesized pointer anywhere.
**
** WHY THIS EXISTS
**
** Until now a touch was turned into a stream of MSG_RAW_MOUSE_POSITION /
** MSG_RAW_MOUSE_*_BUTTON_* messages and handed to the translator chain, which is
** written around a pointer: something that has a position even when nothing is
** pressed, that hovers, that can be parked near a screen edge, and whose button
** releases are guaranteed to arrive. A finger has none of those properties. Every
** control bug reported on this port came out of that gap -- a cursor left sitting on
** a button so the placement ghost drew there, a camera scroll latched by a
** right-button-up that a higher-priority translator legitimately destroyed, an
** ability radius that froze because a pan publishes no positions. Each was fixed
** individually; each fix produced the next report. The premise was wrong, not the
** patches.
**
** WHAT REPLACES IT
**
** The engine's decision-making does NOT require a pointer. It is already reachable
** from a screen point and a world position, and one part of the engine already uses
** it that way: a click on the radar minimap issues real orders through
** evaluateContextCommand() without a single MSG_RAW_MOUSE_* (ControlBarCallback.cpp).
** This module is that same path, for the battlefield:
**
**   TheTacticalView->pickDrawable()          screen point -> object under the finger
**   TheTacticalView->screenToTerrain()       screen point -> world position
**   TheGameClient->evaluateContextCommand()  (object, world) -> the actual order
**   TheInGameUI->selectDrawable() et al      selection
**
** Note especially evaluateContextCommand's EVALUATE_ONLY mode: it answers "would this
** be a legal order" WITHOUT issuing it. That is the real source of truth for target
** feedback, which previously had to be read back out of which cursor bitmap the engine
** had chosen.
**
** WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
**
** Taps on the control bar and menus still go through the ordinary button messages.
** That is not a leftover: a tap on a button IS a click, the window manager's handling
** of it is correct, and nothing about it was ever the problem.
**
** Nothing here invents a message. Everything below MSG_BEGIN_NETWORK_MESSAGES is the
** multiplayer and replay protocol, and the orders this module produces are the same
** MSG_DO_* the mouse path produced, issued by the same engine code.

		 1. A command armed -> the tap is its target. Nothing else can be meant.
		 2. Something the local player owns under the finger -> select it, UNLESS the
				engine says the current selection has a more specific interaction with it
				than "walk over there" (enter it, repair it, ...), in which case that is
				obviously what was meant. EVALUATE_ONLY answers that; we do not guess.
		 3. Anything else, with a controllable selection -> a context order there.
		 4. Otherwise -> clear the selection.

	///
	/// There is deliberately no "fire it" counterpart here. An armed command is committed

	/// guard, evacuate and the rest, and which is what clears the mode on completion --
	/// acts on MSG_MOUSE_LEFT_CLICK and nothing else. Dispatching those by hand would mean
	/// reimplementing the engine's own command rules, which is what this module exists to
	/// avoid. The aiming is still native; only the commit is a click.

	/// (ControlBarCallback.cpp:262). A tap can only be the left one, so with anything
	/// selected there was no way to look at the map at all -- worse, the attempt sent the
	/// army across it. A press-and-hold is the natural second answer, and it is free: the
	/// long-press gesture explicitly ignores points the window manager owns.
	///
	/// Returns TRUE when the point was on the radar and the camera was moved, so the
	/// caller knows to consume the touch instead of replaying it as a click.
