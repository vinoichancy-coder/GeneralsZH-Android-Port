// the swapchain), which surfaces as multi-second input hangs right

// normal poll cycle, so they are captured in an event watcher that fires
// immediately on the delivering thread; the engine update loop checks the
// flag and skips simulation + rendering while backgrounded.

// Two independent reasons to halt the render/sim loop:
//  - BACKGROUNDED (home / switched away): the process is about to be suspended.
//  - INACTIVE (multitasking switcher open, Control Center, a notification
//    banner): iOS snapshots the window and owns the CAMetalLayer drawable during
//    this window — and crucially, opening the app switcher fires resign-active
//    WITHOUT a full background transition.
// Acquiring a Metal drawable during EITHER state fights iOS for the layer; across
// repeated suspend/switcher cycles MoltenVK is driven into an unrecoverable
// surface state and the app crashes (the reported "crashes after backgrounding /
// multitasking a few times"). Pause whenever either is set.

// Touch input (iOS + Android)
//
// SDL's automatic touch-mouse synthesis is disabled on mobile (SDL3Main.cpp
// sets SDL_HINT_TOUCH_MOUSE_EVENTS=0) -- this code owns touch interpretation
// completely.
//
// GeneralsX @feature Android port 01/08/2026, rewritten 01/08/2026 twice
// Native touch control, with NO mouse hardware emulation anywhere:
//
// - Camera pan/zoom call TheTacticalView->userScrollBy()/userZoom()
//   directly (applyCameraPan()/applyCameraZoom()), driven by real per-frame
//   finger deltas. Nothing mouse-shaped is involved at all.
//
// - Selection, GUI clicks, right-click commands, and selection-box/slider
//   drags go straight onto TheMessageStream as the same MSG_RAW_MOUSE_*
//   GameMessages a real mouse would produce (pushMousePosition()/
//   pushMouseButton() below) -- but pushed directly from
//   real finger events, not synthesized as SDL_Event mouse structs fed
//   through SDL3Mouse's hardware-mouse pipeline. This is as close to "no
//   mouse system" as this engine's input architecture allows: selection
//   (SelectionXlat.cpp), GUI hover/hilite (WindowXlat.cpp), and the
//   multiplayer-sync message stream itself are all keyed on that exact
//   GameMessage vocabulary -- built in 2003 for a PC mouse, and there is no
//   bypassing that queue for ANY input device without rewriting those
//   systems (out of scope; this is the original engine's synchronization
//   mechanism for multiplayer/replays, not a design choice we get to
//   route around). What we DO get to remove is everything downstream of
//   that: no persisted cursor object, no OS mouse cursor, no hover-then-
//   click timing built for a physical mouse, no per-frame position
//   heartbeat -- SDL3Mouse::createStreamMessages() is a no-op on mobile
//   (see SDL3Mouse.cpp) specifically so nothing but real touch events ever
//   produces a mouse-shaped message. A GameMessage type being literally
//   named MSG_RAW_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON_DOWN is a historical label, not mouse
//   emulation: no mouse is being pretended to exist, no cursor persists
//   between touches, and nothing here reads back "where the mouse is".
//
// Gestures, deliberately as few and as standard as an Android map/RTS app
// gets:
//   1 finger tap                       -> select / issue command (LMB click)
//   1 finger double-tap                -> select all of that unit's type on
//                                          screen (existing double-click handling)
//   1 finger drag, at ANY point, however long the finger sat still first ->
//                                          direct camera pan, immediately
//   1 finger drag released while still moving fast -> pan keeps coasting,
//                                          decelerating (momentum/inertia),
//                                          until it dies down or another
//                                          finger touches down
//   1 finger held still the whole time, released without ever moving ->
//                                          right-click (issue command)
//   2 fingers                          -> direct camera pan (centroid delta)
//                                          AND zoom (spread delta) together,
//                                          once per frame, unconditionally
//   2 fingers tapped together, both staying near where they landed ->
//                                          right-click (fast "cancel selection")
//
// GeneralsX @refactor Find N5 fork 28/09/2026 The list above is the original design and
// several entries have since changed: a still long press now cancels natively
// (TouchInput::cancelOrDeselect) after a player-set time, press-hold-drag and
// tap-then-drag both draw a selection box, and an on-screen cancel button has its own
// phase. docs/port/TOUCH_CONTROLS.md and the README's gesture table are current.
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026, again Movement now ALWAYS wins
// over hold-duration, no matter when it happens. The previous cut fired the
// long-press right-click proactively the instant LONG_PRESS_MS elapsed
// (600ms) while the finger was still down, and any further drag from there
// upgraded to a selection-box drag instead of a pan -- so a completely
// ordinary drag that started with as little as half a second's hesitation
// (touch down, get oriented, THEN start moving -- unremarkable human
// timing) silently turned into "select a box of units" instead of "pan the
// camera", with no camera movement and no obvious visual cue why. Reported
// as "I drag with one finger like every other Android RTS and the camera
// just doesn't move, I'm stuck standing at my base". Fixed by resolving the
// long-press ONLY at release: if the finger crosses the pan dead zone at
// ANY time before lifting, however long it sat still first, it's a pan --
// long-press right-click only fires if the finger never moved at all,
// checked once, when it lifts. This removes single-finger press-and-hold-
// then-drag box-select entirely (it's what directly conflicted with "any
// drag pans") -- if box-select turns out to still be wanted, it needs its
// own separate gesture, not sharing single-finger drag with panning.
//
// GeneralsX @feature Android port 01/08/2026, again Two-finger tap-to-
// cancel is back: dropped in an earlier pass as "redundant with the
// single-finger long-press", but it's faster and more natural for
// "cancel/deselect" than reaching for a long-press, and was asked back
// explicitly. This does NOT reintroduce the old pan-vs-zoom classifier --
// TWOFINGER still always applies both pan and zoom every frame,
// unconditionally. This only ADDS a check at release: if neither finger
// moved more than TWO_FINGER_TAP_MAX_PX from where it landed, the whole
// gesture is also a tap -> fire right-click at the landing centroid.
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026 Previous revisions tried to
// classify a two-finger gesture as EITHER pan OR zoom (a "one finger
// anchored, the other drags vertically" heuristic with a commit distance,
// a displacement ratio, and a co-directionality check) before applying
// anything -- built to fix an OLDER architecture where zoom was a discrete
// wheel-tick and any accidental pan alongside it was jarring. That
// architecture is gone: pan and zoom are now both continuous, real-pixel,
// 1:1 camera control, so feeding both signals every frame -- exactly the way
// a normal two-finger touch UI (map apps, browsers, Rusted Warfare) already
// works -- is simply correct. A little pan drift from two hands never moving
// in perfect lockstep during a pinch is imperceptible next to the zoom
// itself; the classifier was solving a problem this architecture doesn't
// have, and its heuristics were exactly why zoom worked "sometimes" --
// real symmetric two-hand pinches (both fingers moving, neither "anchored")
// routinely failed the ratio check and were misclassified as pan.
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026 A prior revision added a fixed
// settle window (re-anchoring the pan reference point for the first 100ms
// after touch-down) to keep ordinary hold-still tremor from hijacking a tap
// into a pan. That timer could also silently eat an entire quick, deliberate
// flick if the whole gesture finished inside the window -- reported as
// "can't pan with my finger at all". Removed in favor of the simplest
// standard approach: a single dead-zone distance (TAP_DEAD_ZONE_PX) decides
// tap vs. drag, no timer involved, matching how every ordinary Android touch
// UI (not just this engine) already disambiguates the two.

// Pan and zoom call TheTacticalView directly (userScrollBy/userSetPosition,
// userZoom) every touch-motion event. No fake cursor, no click/drag timing
// heuristics sized for a physical mouse -- the finger IS the camera control.
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026 The first cut passed the
// finger's raw NORMALIZED (0..1 window-fraction) per-frame delta straight
// into userScrollBy(); the second cut fixed that to a real PIXEL delta
// divided by W3DView::scrollBy()'s own SCROLL_RESOLUTION=250 constant,
// reasoning that matching scrollBy()'s own internal divisor was sufficient.
// It wasn't: real device logs (GX_TRACE'd applyCameraPan calls during an
// actual on-device drag) showed userScrollBy() being called every motion
// event, never locked, with a nonzero delta each time -- and the camera's
// getPosition2D() moving by roughly 0.02-0.1 world units per call against a
// position around 1300-2000. A drag summing to 500+ screen pixels only
// moved the camera a few TENTHS of a world unit total: real motion, just
// three-plus orders of magnitude too small to ever be visible. scrollBy()'s
// SCROLL_RESOLUTION constant was tuned against the OLD PC RMB-drag path
// (LookAtXlat.cpp's SCROLL_RMB, its own separate SCROLL_AMT/SCROLL_MULTIPLIER
// constants, called every FRAME while held, not once per motion event) --
// matching just the one constant it shares was nowhere near enough to
// reproduce that path's actual feel, and nobody had verified the real
// on-screen result until now.
//
// Fixed by abandoning scrollBy()'s pixel-based formula entirely in favor of
// the same ground projection the engine already uses elsewhere for exactly
// this purpose (SelectionXlat.cpp's mouseover-terrain hint):
// View::screenToTerrain(). Project the finger's previous and current screen
// position to world/terrain coordinates using the CURRENT (not-yet-moved)
// camera, and move the camera by the difference -- this is dimensionally
// exact by construction (it's asking "where does this screen point actually
// sit on the ground", not guessing a pixel-to-world ratio) and adapts
// automatically to zoom level, camera angle, and screen resolution, unlike
// a fixed constant. Applied via userSetPosition() (a direct position
// setter) rather than userScrollBy(), since scrollBy()'s own pixel-delta
// reinterpretation is exactly what we're bypassing.
//
// ZOOM_HEIGHT_PER_PIXEL: calibrated against the exact sensitivity the old
// discrete wheel-tick zoom already used and was tuned for (ZOOM_PX_PER_TICK
// pixels of pinch movement == one wheel tick == View::ZoomHeightPerSecond
// world-height-units), just made continuous instead of stepped. Zoom's
// calibration was never in question -- it doesn't route through scrollBy()
// at all, and real device logs confirm userZoom() moves the camera by a
